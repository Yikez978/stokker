# Stokker - Stock screener based on Spring-Boot/Integration + Elastic Search

## Summary

This a personal learning project whose functionality, for the moment, is to:
- Gather historical stock quotations from Yahoo Finance 
- Gather "live" stock quotations from Google Finance
- Index everything in a Elasticsearch node so queries, graphs and alarms can be generated.

By "stock quotations", I mean:
- High, low, open and close values (daily values)
- Volume (daily)
- Ticker
- Timestamp of the current value


Desired functionality
- Be able to perform some studies in the indexed data in ES (specially, I´m waiting for some ES 2.0 features such as the moving average). This is a sample dashboard created with the information stored in ES:

![Sample Kibana Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/victor-ferrer/stokker/master/sample%20dashboard.PNG)

- Use the module "Watcher" in order to define several types of alerts based on market conditions.
- Give the user a GUI, if possible, integrated with some Kibana dashboard.
- Assess whether some Portfolio management functionality would be interesting.

On technical side:
- The latest Spring Boot version is to be used
- Application contains a DockerFile and can create an Docker image from it:
-- This image can be associated with another images running more ElasticSearch nodes and the Kibana server

 
## How to use it
Check [this Wiki Page](https://github.com/victor-ferrer/stokker/wiki/How-to-run-the-Stokker-services) on how to run the project and its related tools.

## Pending improvements
- Improve error reporting
- Provide a GUI with embedded Kibana visualizations
- And many more...
